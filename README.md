# Coder

A reverse engineering project for Claude Code, enabling customization and multi-model integration for enhanced development workflows.

## Overview

Coder analyzes Claude Code's architecture to extract core components and enable extensive customization:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Extract and modify system prompts and behavioral instructions
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Isolate and extend built-in tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, etc.)
- **Model Integration**: Support multiple OpenAI-compatible APIs and models
- **Interface Customization**: Modify UI/UX for personalized development experience

## Key Features

### Core Extraction
- Reverse engineer system prompts and instruction templates
- Separate built-in tool implementations for independent usage
- Map interaction patterns between prompts and tools

### Customization Capabilities
- **Custom Prompts**: Create specialized instruction sets for different workflows
- **Multi-Model Support**: Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models
- **Personalized Interface**: Tailor the development environment to your preferences

### Enhanced Development Experience
- Custom workflow templates for specific use cases
- Extended toolchain for specialized development tasks
- Flexible model selection for optimal performance
- Improved interface design and functionality

## Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development** - Currently reverse engineering Claude Code's architecture and building customization framework.

## Purpose

This project is for educational and customization purposes. It aims to understand Claude Code's architecture to create improved, customizable alternatives while respecting the original tool's design principles.
